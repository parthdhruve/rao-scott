# Rao-Scott

This is a work in progress repository for a Rao-Scott first-order correction for chi-squared tests of indepdence in Python. The implementation is as described in Decedy & Thomas (2000) [1]. This should be used to correct for non-independence in data when performing chi-squared tests of independence. An example of when this would arise is in multiple-response sruvey data (e.g., questions of the format "select all that apply").
